# TGS Salt Identification Challenge

The idea is to use Unet with Fastai. As Unet is currently the most efficient model for image recognization. Also, instead of using keras, the reason I go for fastai is it is really easy to understand, and quite efficient source with pytorch running as a backend. 

Currently I am ranked at 248 / 1149, please use Jimmy H as a keyword to search on https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge/leaderboard . As for the strategies I use, I will write down my thoughts about the competition after it finish. 

You can use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to open jupyter notebook if you failed to view the source code.
