# TGS

The idea is to use Unet with Fastai. As Unet is currently the most efficient model for image recognization. Also, instead of using keras, the reason I go for fastai is it is really easy to understand, and quite efficient source with pytorch running as a backend. 

I will write down my thoughts about the competition after the competition finish. 

You can use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to open jupyter notebook if you failed to view the source code.
